    <h1>Chevrolet Camaro (first generation)</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The first-generation Chevrolet Camaro is an American muscle car introduced by Chevrolet in the fall of 1966 for
        the 1967 model year. It rode on a brand-new rear wheel drive GM F-body platform and was available as a 2-door,
        2+2 seat, hardtop, and convertible. The F-body was shared with the Pontiac Firebird for all generations. A 230
        cu in Chevrolet straight-6 was standard, with several Chevy V8s available as options.[5][6] The first-generation
        Camaro was built through the 1969 model year.
        Almost all of 1967–1969 Camaros were built in the two U.S. assembly plants: Norwood, Ohio and Van Nuys,
        California. There were also five non-U.S. Camaro assembly plants in countries that required local assembly and
        content. These plants were located in the Philippines, Belgium, Switzerland, Venezuela, and Peru.[7]

    <h2>1967</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The body style for the 1967 Camaro was designed by the same team that designed the new 1965 edition of the
        Corvair. The Camaro shared the subframe / semi-unibody design with the 1968 Chevy II Nova. Almost 80
        factory-installed and 40 dealer options, including three main trim packages, were available: the RS, the SS, and
        the Z/28.

        The SS included a 350 cu in (5.7 L) producing 295 bhp (299 PS; 220 kW) at 4800 rpm and 380 lb⋅ft (515 N⋅m) at
        3200 rpm of torque;[12] and the L35 and L78 396 cu in (6.5 L) big-block V8 engines producing 325 bhp (330 PS;
        242 kW) or 375 bhp (380 PS; 280 kW) at 5600 rpm and 415 lb⋅ft (563 N⋅m) at 3600 rpm of torque were
        available.[13] The SS featured non-functional air inlets on the hood, special striping, and SS badging on the
        grille, front fenders, gas cap, and horn button. It was possible to order both the SS and RS options, making it
        a RS/SS. In 1967, a Camaro RS/SS convertible with a 396 engine paced the Indianapolis 500.

    <h2>1968</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The styling of the 1968 Camaro was very similar to the 1967 design. With the introduction of Astro Ventilation,
        a fresh-air-inlet system, the side vent windows were deleted. Side marker lights were added on the front and
        rear fenders as part of safety requirements for all 1968 vehicles. It also had a more pointed front grille and
        divided rear taillights. The front running lights (on non-RS models) were also changed from circular to oval.
        The big-block SS models received chrome hood inserts that imitated velocity stacks and low-gloss black rear tail
        light panel.

        The rear shock absorber mounting was staggered to resolve wheel hop issues and higher performance models
        received multi-leaf rear springs instead of single-leaf units. A 396 cu in (6.5 L) producing 350 hp (261 kW) at
        5200 rpm and 415 lb⋅ft (563 N⋅m) of torque at 3400 rpm big block engine was added as an option for the SS,[19]
        and the Z28 appeared in Camaro brochures. The 427 cu in (7.0 L) was not available as a Regular Production Option
        (RPO).

        Chevrolet's Special Production Division had to convince Chevrolet's General Manager Pete Estes, but the General
        Manager only drove convertible vehicles, and the Z/28 was never produced as a convertible. A Central Office
        Production Order (COPO) was placed for the only Z/28 convertible Camaro built.[20] The car was parked in the
        executive garage which Pete Estes had access to. Upon driving the vehicle, he promptly gave approval for
        promoting the Z/28. A 1968 Z/28 competed in the 1971 British Saloon Car Championship at Crystal Palace in a
        three-way battle for the lead, a race which was later featured in the "Sporting Moments" episode of BBC's 100
        Greatest series.[

    <h2>1969</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The 1969 Camaro carried over the previous year's drivetrain and major mechanical components, but all-new sheet
        metal, except the hood trunk lid and roof, gave the car a substantially sportier look. The grille was redesigned
        with a heavy "V" cant and deeply inset headlights. New door skins, rear quarter panels, and rear valance panel
        also gave the car a much lower, wider, more aggressive look. This styling would serve for the 1969 model year
        only.

        To increase competitiveness in the SCCA Trans-Am racing series, optional four-wheel disc brakes with four-piston
        calipers were made available during the year, under RPO JL8, for US$500.30.[22] This system used components from
        the Corvette and made for a major improvement in the braking capability and was a key to winning the Trans-Am
        championship. The option was expensive and only 206 units were produced.

        The Rally Sport (RS) option, RPO Z22, includes a special black-painted grille with concealed headlights and
        headlight washers, fender striping (except when sport striping or Z28 Special Performance Package is specified),
        simulated rear fender louvers, front and rear wheel opening moldings, black body sill, RS emblems on grille,
        steering wheel and rear panel, Rally Sport front fender nameplates, bright accented taillights, back-up lights
        below rear bumper; also includes bright roof drip moldings on Sport Coupe. $131.65, 37,773 built. This option
        could be added to any other option (i.e., SS or Z/28), making the model an RS/SS or an RS/Z28.

        The Z28 option was still available with the 302 cu in (4.9 L) small block producing 290 hp (294 PS; 216 kW) at
        5800 rpm and 290 lb⋅ft (393 N⋅m) of torque at 4200 rpm.[23] It was backed by Muncie four-speed with a new-for-69
        standard Hurst shifter and connected to a 12-bolt rear axle with standard 3.73 gears. The 302 featured 11:1
        compression, forged pistons, forged steel crankshaft and connecting rods, solid lifter camshaft, and Holley
        carburetion on a dual-plane intake manifold. A dual four-barrel crossram intake manifold was available as a
        dealer-installed option.[22]

        The 1969 model year was exceptionally long, extending into November 1969, due to manufacturing problems that
        delayed the introduction of the second generation model planned for 1970.
